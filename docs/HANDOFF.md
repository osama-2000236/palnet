# HANDOFF.md — current state + next steps

> Location: `docs/HANDOFF.md`.
> Read after `CLAUDE.md` and `DESIGN.md`. This tells you exactly where to start.

## What's done (design side)

- ✅ Brand name locked: **Baydar (بيدر)**. See `BRAND.md`.
- ✅ Token system rewritten (olive + terracotta, 5-surface hierarchy, 7-step type scale).
- ✅ Working interactive prototype covers 5 screens: Feed, Profile, Network, Messages, Search.
- ✅ 6 component specs written (Button, Avatar, Surface, PostCard, MessageBubble, AppShell).
- ✅ RTL rules documented.
- ✅ Mobile-specific overrides documented.
- ✅ Testing definition-of-done documented.

## What's done (code side)

- ✅ Turborepo monorepo scaffolded (`apps/web`, `apps/mobile`, `packages/ui-tokens`, `packages/ui-web`, `packages/ui-native`, `packages/api`, `packages/db`).
- ✅ `apps/web` boots (Next.js 15 App Router) with RTL `<html dir="rtl">`.
- ✅ Auth (Lucia), Prisma schema, basic feed/profile routes wired.
- 🟡 Token values are still the OLD generic-blue palette — **replace first thing** with files from `handoff/packages/ui-tokens/*`.
- 🟡 Components currently hardcode cards, no Surface variants, no avatars in many places.
- ⏳ Mobile app not started (folder exists, empty).

## What's NOT done

- ⏳ AppShell organism (web nav + mobile tabs).
- ⏳ Empty states + skeletons.
- ⏳ Mobile app (entire).
- ⏳ Final logo mark (placeholder in prototype, replace before launch).
- ⏳ Proper image uploads (+ blurhash).
- ⏳ Search filters beyond "people".
- ⏳ Jobs, Notifications screens.
- ⏳ Settings, billing, admin screens.

## Sprint plan — next 6 sprints

Each sprint = ~1 week of focused work. Order matters; don't skip ahead.

### Sprint 1 — Foundation swap (web) ✅ DONE

**Goal:** get the web app onto the new tokens + surface system. No new features.

1. ✅ Replace `packages/ui-tokens/src/index.ts` with the file from `handoff/`.
2. ✅ Regenerate `tokens.css` + `tokens.native.ts`.
3. ✅ Wire the Tailwind preset in `apps/web/tailwind.config.ts`.
4. ✅ Load IBM Plex Sans Arabic + Noto Naskh Arabic via `next/font/google` in `app/layout.tsx`.
5. ✅ Global search-replace any `bg-blue-*`, `text-slate-*`, raw hex in components → token class.
6. ✅ Build `<Surface>` atom in `packages/ui-web`. Replace every ad-hoc card in the app.
7. ✅ Build `<Avatar>` atom. Drop it into every place a person appears.
8. ✅ Run `pnpm lint:tokens` — green across web + mobile + ui-web.
9. ✅ Visual-QA every existing screen against the prototype. Gap list below feeds Sprints 2–4.

**Definition of done:** app looks like the prototype's olive aesthetic, even though features haven't changed.

#### Sprint 1 QA gap list (observed vs. prototype)

Things that *look* wrong today but are on the roadmap — not Sprint 1 fixes:

- **No AppShell.** Every `(app)` route has its own inline header with hand-rolled
  link buttons + a bell. Prototype has a sticky top nav with logo, rounded search
  pill, 5 nav items (home/network/jobs/messages/notifications), avatar dropdown.
  → Sprint 2.
- **Feed is a single 680px column.** Prototype is a 3-column grid (225 / 1fr / 300):
  left rail mini-profile hero with olive gradient, center column, right rail with
  "People you may know" + "Suggested jobs" + footer caption. → Sprint 3.
- **Composer is always expanded.** Prototype collapses to avatar + "Start a post…"
  pill + inline icon buttons, expands on click. → Sprint 3.
- **PostCard missing the reactions badge row.** Prototype shows an olive circle
  with a thumb icon + count, stats line ("N comments · N reposts"), divider, then
  a 4-button action bar (like / comment / repost / send) where each button grows
  `flex: 1`. Our card is: body → 3-button footer. → Sprint 3.
- **Messages thread has no bubble component.** Current implementation inlines
  `self-end bg-brand-600` for own messages, `bg-ink-muted/10` for other. Prototype
  wants a real `<MessageBubble>` with status ticks, time grouping, online dot on
  the header avatar. → Sprint 4.
- **No skeletons.** Every loading state is a "…" glyph. Prototype assumes skeleton
  shapes that match the real content. → Sprint 3/6.
- **Empty states are bare `<p>` tags.** Prototype expects title + description +
  primary action. → Sprint 6.
- **NotificationsBell icon is a custom inline SVG.** Once AppShell lands it will
  consume the shared `Icon` atom (not yet built). → Sprint 2.

Cosmetic-but-cheap items that *did* land in Sprint 1:

- Every surface routes through the 5-variant `<Surface>` atom (flat/card/hero/tinted/row).
- Every person uses `<Avatar>` (xs/sm/md/lg/xl, ring, online dot) on a deterministic
  token-backed palette.
- Brand olive + terracotta accent are the only colors; no Tailwind default palettes remain.
- Status chips ("online" in messages, "live" in notifications) use `success` token.
- Unread badges use `accent-600`; own-message bubbles use `brand-600` — the two
  signals no longer collide.

### Sprint 2 — AppShell + nav (web) ✅ DONE

1. ✅ Build `<AppShell>` per `docs/components/AppShell.md`.
2. ✅ Wrap every `(app)` route in it (new `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/layout.tsx`).
3. ✅ Make search input navigate to `/search` on keystroke.
4. ✅ Wire unread counts from Messages + Notifications (SSE, both streams).
5. ✅ Add `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` search focus.
6. ✅ Profile menu dropdown: "View profile", "Settings", "Sign out".
7. ✅ Keyboard tab order audit (Tab through nav, ⬅/➡ rove RTL-aware,
   Home/End jump, ⬆/⬇ navigate open menu, Esc closes + returns focus).

**Landed in Sprint 2:**

- New atom `<Icon>` (exported from `@palnet/ui-web`) consolidates every inline
  SVG glyph — home / users / briefcase / message / bell / search / chevron-down /
  thumb / repost / send / check / x / more / plus / bookmark / logo. Always
  inherits `currentColor`, never ships a hex.
- New organism `<AppShell>` with 5 nav slots + profile menu + search pill.
  `aria-current="page"` on the active item, `aria-label` on the <nav> landmark,
  badges announce unread counts via an `sr-only` template (e.g. "3 رسائل غير
  مقروءة"). `focus-visible` ring on every interactive element.
- `(app)/layout.tsx` is the one place that fetches `/profiles/me`, subscribes
  to `/notifications/stream` and `/messaging/stream`, and keeps the badge
  numbers live. `/onboarding` is exempt (no shell before the user has a
  profile).
- Feed page stopped hand-rolling its cross-nav header (`NotificationsBell` +
  inline text links) — that responsibility lives in the shell now.
- New `nav.*` translations (ar + en) keep the shell free of hardcoded strings.

### Sprint 2 QA gap list (observed vs. prototype)

Things scoped for later sprints so Sprint 2 stays "chrome only":

- **Jobs screen is a 404.** The nav links to `/jobs` but the route doesn't
  exist yet. → Sprint 6.
- **Profile menu has no avatar hero inside the dropdown.** Prototype shows
  a compact me-card at the top of the menu (avatar + name + headline + "View
  profile" CTA). Today's menu is a plain list. → Sprint 3 (lands with the
  left-rail mini profile) or Sprint 6 polish.
- **Search debounce.** Every keystroke pushes the URL and triggers the search
  page's fetch. Acceptable because the search page already fetches on value
  change, but a 150ms debounce on the router push would cut churn. → Sprint 3
  or later.
- **Mobile top bar.** The spec calls for the web shell on ≥ md; small screens
  should collapse to tabs (per `docs/design/MOBILE.md`). Currently the web
  shell renders everywhere. → Sprint 5 when the mobile app lands.

### Sprint 3 — Feed polish ✅ DONE

1. ✅ Shared `<Composer>` in `packages/ui-web` — two-state (collapsed pill
   with 3 quiet icon chips; expanded avatar + name + autoFocus textarea +
   media tray + char counter + submit). Web host owns upload + post.
2. ✅ Shared `<PostCard>` in `packages/ui-web` — header with Avatar md +
   name + headline + time + audience line + `…` menu, body at 15/1.7,
   media grid, stats row with olive thumb badge, divider, 4-button
   action bar (like/comment/repost/send, `flex-1` each), and a
   `commentsSlot` the host mounts the existing Comments region into.
3. ✅ Shared `<PostCardSkeleton>` matching the card layout — rendered
   while the first page of `/feed` is fetching.
4. ✅ Backend: `GET /connections/suggestions?limit=N` → returns
   `{ data: PersonSuggestion[] }`. Excludes every userId the viewer
   already has any connection row with. `PersonSuggestion` now lives
   in `packages/shared/src/schemas/connection.ts` so the mobile app
   can reuse the exact same shape in Sprint 5.
5. ✅ Feed page rewritten as `225 / 1fr / 300` grid on `lg:`; collapses
   to a single column below. Left rail = mini-profile hero (olive
   gradient + ringed lg avatar + headline). Right rail = PYMK list
   (first 4) + "Suggested jobs (قريبًا)" placeholder + footer caption.
6. ✅ Empty state — tinted surface with home glyph + title + description,
   replaces the old flat one-liner.
7. ✅ Optimistic reactions — unchanged logic, now running inside the
   shared PostCard shell via `onToggleReaction` + `busy` prop.

**Landed in Sprint 3:**

- `packages/ui-web/src/Composer.tsx` + `PostCard.tsx` + `PostCardSkeleton.tsx`
- `packages/shared/src/schemas/connection.ts` — `PersonSuggestion` schema
- `apps/api/src/modules/connections/*` — `suggestions()` + controller route
- `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/feed/page.tsx` — 3-col layout + rails
- `apps/web/src/components/{Composer,PostCard}.tsx` — thin host wrappers
- `apps/web/messages/{ar-PS,en}.json` — `post.*`, `feed.rail.*`, `composer.*`

#### Sprint 3 QA gap list (observed vs. prototype)

Things scoped for later sprints so Sprint 3 stays "feed-only":

- **Left-rail connection count is a placeholder `—`.** The card fetches
  `me` but not `/connections/counts`; the prototype shows "الاتصالات · 142".
  Cheap to add — one `apiFetch("/connections/counts", ...)` in the same
  effect. → Sprint 6 polish.
- **PYMK "Connect" button navigates to the profile instead of sending a
  request inline.** The backend already has `POST /connections`, but a
  one-click connect flow needs a confirm modal per the Network spec.
  → Sprint 6.
- **Suggested jobs is literally a "قريبًا" card.** Jobs ships Sprint 6.
- **No comments pagination in the Comments slot.** The existing
  `<Comments>` component handles it; verified still works — but the
  tinted comments region could use a compact scroll container when the
  list grows past ~6. → Sprint 6 polish.
- **PostCard timestamp is `toLocaleString()`** — prototype wants relative
  ("قبل ٣ ساعات") with absolute on hover. → Sprint 6.
- **Repost + Share actions are no-ops.** Per spec the handlers exist on
  the shared shell; host wiring lands with repost composer. → Sprint 6.

### Sprint 4 — Messages ✅ DONE

1. ✅ Build `<MessageBubble>` per spec (no CTA-color collision — mine uses `brand-100` fill, never `brand-600`).
2. ✅ Thread grouping (runs of consecutive messages; 2-min window, 10-min gap-before triggers timestamp).
3. ✅ Status ticks (sending/sent/delivered/read/failed) — pragmatic mapping: pending client id → sending, other's `lastReadAt >= createdAt` → read, else sent. Delivered enum reserved for future receipts.
4. ✅ Online dot on avatars in room list (2-min `lastSeenAt` threshold).
5. ✅ Type-ahead indicator — 3s outgoing throttle, 5s client-side TTL, fanout via `POST /messaging/rooms/:id/typing` + SSE `typing` event (no persistence).
6. ✅ Room list search — client-side filter over firstName/lastName/handle/title/lastMessage.body.

#### Sprint 4 QA gap list (deferred to Sprint 6)

- **No message edit/delete.** Spec doesn't call for either in v1.
- **No media in messages.** `mediaUrl` field exists in the DTO; no upload path or renderer yet.
- **No group rooms.** `isGroup` + `title` exist on `ChatRoom` but creation UX + member management are not built.
- **No jump-to-unread scroll.** Thread opens at the newest message; we don't scroll to the first unread.
- **No read-receipt per-recipient list for groups.** Single `lastReadAt` per member is stored; UI picks "the other" member in DMs only.
- **Typing indicator is server-ephemeral.** If a tab reconnects mid-burst, it misses the in-flight event. Acceptable for v1.
- **`lastSeenAt` is not bumped by this app yet.** The column exists; wiring a heartbeat on SSE-connect is a Sprint 6 task.

### Sprint 5 — Mobile app kickoff 🟡 IN PROGRESS

1. ✅ Expo app boots with IBM Plex Sans Arabic + Noto Naskh Arabic bundled via `@expo-google-fonts`; RTL forced at root via `I18nManager.forceRTL`.
2. ✅ Auth wires to `packages/api` (pre-existing; unchanged this sprint).
3. ✅ Bottom-tab AppShell — 5 tabs (feed · network · messages · notifications · search). Non-tab routes (composer, onboarding, me/edit, in/[handle]) render via `href: null` so they push without showing a tab.
4. ✅ `packages/ui-native` scaffolded with `Avatar`, `Button`, `Surface` — prop APIs mirror ui-web (same variants, same sizes, `onClick` → `onPress`). Canonical web `Button` also landed alongside.
5. 🟡 Feed screen dogfooded with `Surface` + `Avatar` + token-styled text; `PostRow` now uses the shared atoms. Other screens still on inline ad-hoc styling — port as needed in Sprint 6.
6. ⏳ Profile screen not yet ported to ui-native atoms (still inline).
7. ⏳ Messages screen not yet ported (still inline, no swipe-to-archive).

#### Sprint 5 QA gap list (deferred / deliberate debt)

- **Other mobile screens (messages, network, search, notifications, onboarding, me/edit, in/[handle]) still use raw RN primitives + nativewind classes.** Port to `Surface` / `Avatar` / `Button` incrementally.
- **Tab icons are emoji stubs.** Port the web `Icon` atom to `ui-native` and replace the `TabGlyph` text nodes.
- **Swipe-to-archive on room rows** not implemented (needs `react-native-gesture-handler` + a `Swipeable` wrapper).
- **Messages → thread uses the default push animation** (tab bar stays visible). Standard mobile pattern is "modal-like" presentation that hides the tab; revisit if users complain.
- **`lint:tokens` now scans `apps/mobile/app` + `packages/ui-native/src`** too — any new hex in those trees fails the check.
- **Font loading blocks on a blank `surfaceMuted` view** instead of a proper splash with the Baydar mark. Logo art is still a placeholder anyway.
- **Mobile still uses `nativewind` for existing screens.** ui-native atoms deliberately use React Native `StyleSheet` + `nativeTokens` so the package stays framework-agnostic; nativewind remains available to host code.

### Sprint 6 — Jobs + Notifications + polish

1. Jobs listing + job detail screens (web + mobile).
2. Notifications center with read/unread state.
3. Empty states + skeletons everywhere missing.
4. Accessibility pass (axe-core clean).
5. Arabic translation QA by native speaker.
6. Perf budget check.

## What Claude Code should NOT do

- ❌ Redesign anything. The prototype + DESIGN.md is the design. If you want to change a decision, ask the user — don't unilaterally "improve."
- ❌ Add features not on the sprint plan. Ship the boring thing first.
- ❌ Use any component from shadcn/ui / Radix themes without mapping it to our tokens first. Radix **primitives** (unstyled, headless) are fine; Radix **themed** components are not.
- ❌ Add dark mode. It's not designed yet.
- ❌ Add TypeScript `any` to get past a type error. If it's legitimately hard, ask.
- ❌ Add a new dependency without asking. Especially UI libraries.

## File-drop plan (paths to use when placing this package in the repo)

Copy these files from `handoff/` to these repo paths:

| From | To |
|---|---|
| `handoff/CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `handoff/DESIGN.md` | `DESIGN.md` |
| `handoff/BRAND.md` | `BRAND.md` |
| `handoff/HANDOFF.md` | `docs/HANDOFF.md` |
| `handoff/packages/ui-tokens/src/index.ts` | `packages/ui-tokens/src/index.ts` |
| `handoff/packages/ui-tokens/src/tokens.css` | `packages/ui-tokens/src/tokens.css` |
| `handoff/packages/ui-tokens/src/tokens.native.ts` | `packages/ui-tokens/src/tokens.native.ts` |
| `handoff/packages/ui-tokens/tailwind-preset.ts` | `packages/ui-tokens/tailwind-preset.ts` |
| `handoff/docs/components/*.md` | `docs/components/*.md` |
| `handoff/docs/design/RTL.md` | `docs/design/RTL.md` |
| `handoff/docs/design/MOBILE.md` | `docs/design/MOBILE.md` |
| `handoff/docs/design/TESTING.md` | `docs/design/TESTING.md` |
| `handoff/docs/design/prototype/*` | `docs/design/prototype/*` |

After copying, delete the `handoff/` folder from this design project — it lives in the repo now.

## Final sanity check before starting Sprint 1

Run these commands. All must succeed:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tokens:build          # regenerates tokens.css + tokens.native.ts
pnpm --filter apps/web dev  # renders in olive palette, RTL, Arabic fonts loaded
open docs/design/prototype/PalNet\ Prototype.html  # visual reference still works
```

If any of those fail, fix them before writing a single new component.
